<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Allow me to provide you with some background information about myself. I am a 32-year-old
  professional living in Miklav≈æ na Dravskem polju, Slovenia. I completed my vocational education in
  tourism and gastronomy in Maribor, where I gained a solid foundation in customer service and
  problem-solving. While pursuing my vocational studies, I discovered my inclination towards
  technology and decided to further my education in traffic engineering.
  During my studies, I became intrigued by programming. Recognizing the significance of
  programming, I embarked on a self-learning journey to acquire the necessary skills. I have been
  diligently learning and exploring various online resources to enhance my knowledge and practical
  understanding of programming in JavaScript and TypeScript. Although I consider myself a beginner, I
  am highly motivated to continue learning and growing in this field.
  My educational background has instilled in me the ability to approach challenges with a methodical
  and analytical mindset. I am a quick learner and possess excellent problem-solving skills, which I
  believe are vital for success in the realm of development. Additionally, my experience in the tourism
  and gastronomy industry has honed my interpersonal and communication skills, enabling me to
  collaborate effectively within a team and adapt to diverse working environments.
  I am confident that my passion for programming, combined with my dedication to continuous
  improvement and quick learning ability, will make me a valuable asset to your team. I am eager to
  contribute my skills, learn from experienced professionals, and actively participate in the
  development of innovative and impactful projects at your company.
